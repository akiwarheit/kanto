A monorepo for a Pokemon-inspired project.

## What is it?

1. A Pokedex
2. A custom TV launcher
3. I dunno, a data science project at some point as well? who's to say.

## Why?

Aside from being a good [kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)), I wanted to get first-hand experience with monorepos using yarn workspace.
