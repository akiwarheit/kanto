> A yarn workspace for a Pokemon-inspired kata.

## What?

1. @kanto/jenny A Raspberry Pi streaming baby monitor
2. @kanto/joy Analysis dashboard WIP
3. @kanto/oak Common libraries
4. @kanto/pallet React Native UI library
5. @kanto/pokedex A PokeDex App
6. @kanto/rotomtv React Native TV project (custom launcher)


## Why?

Aside from being a good [kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)), I wanted to get first-hand experience with monorepos using yarn workspace.
